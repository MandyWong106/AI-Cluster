# AI-Cluster
This project is to demonstrate how the following 3 cluster algorithm could be implemented
1. K Mean - the output of every loop will be displayed
2. Hierarchical - the distance matrix can be used instead of data point, and the output also show how would the distance matrix be updated after each loop
3. DBScan - datapoint will be classified as core, border, outliner, and grouped accordingly

More description could be found in each .java in src folder
